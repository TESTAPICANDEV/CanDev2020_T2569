	//User would enter a set of job tasks.

	//These task can either be previously sought out or not

	//if so, the task would be described as a data object which contains a list of associated job skills that HR professionals would evaluate

	//These job skills in turn are data objects that contain a list of possible qualifications/certifications/experiences that teach/develop these skills

	//These qualifications are then used in a scrubbing software to parse resume data for keywords.

	//Data should be stored in std::map containers

	//Software should have pivot table functionallity for run-time Data Sorting based on desired headings

	//if no data exists for a particular task, then the HR proffessional would systemically record their process for future hiring sessions

	//The library of terms can be initialized by conducting an internal study of skills and qualifications of current officers using our systemic approach.

	//That is describing Jobs Tasks are Professional Skills which are described as potential Qualitfication/Certification that teach these Skills.
